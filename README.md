## Introduction
My name is Francisco Almeida aka Kikito.
I'm a 19 year old male from Portugal.

You can find me on these socials:

- Discord: **Kikito#9669**

I'm studying to have multiple technical areas such as:
  - Web Developer (Need to finish a course for JavaScript and TypeScript)
  - Data Analyst (Finishing a course from Google)
  - Game Developer (Need to study a blender course and a C#/C++ course)

You can find my web developer repos in my profile or in my organization.

I also have a website that I host a remote connection to my computer but it's not working at the moment.

My main organization is [Project SAO](https://github.com/Project-SAO).
I was working in a game with a friend but we are not working in that project at the moment.

I'm starting a carrer as a Data Analyst so expect new repos with R code and other updates to my socials.

Have a nice day!
